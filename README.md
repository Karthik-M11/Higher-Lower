# Higher-Lower
The classic Higher-Lower game built in python.

## Description
In this game, players guess whether the next Instagram account has more or fewer followers than the current one. Starting with a randomly chosen account, players make predictions based on follower counts. Correct guesses continue the game, while incorrect guesses end it. The aim is to make as many correct guesses in a row as possible.
